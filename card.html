			<h2>Birthday Card</h2>
			<i><p>For privacy reasons name is omitted.</p></i>

			<p>
I completely recognize this might not be<br>
a very specialized or personalized birthday gift.<br>
<br>
However I felt a digital birthday card would've been
quite the cop-out, since that takes nearly no effort on my part.<br>
<br>
Not being a very naturally expressive person, admittedly I could not think
of anything too good to get, but I elected to do something a bit more effort
on my part.
<br><br>
The story is not too great, however it's just supposed to be a passing entertainment.
<br><br>
While this story might not be entirely entertaining, if you even
found it interesting for a minute or two or found it funny then
I've done my job.

you cannot actually see any of my thought process but eh.
