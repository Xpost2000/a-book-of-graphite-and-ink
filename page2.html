			<h2>A Little Background?</h2>
			<p>
Samuel went ahead and submerged himself in the forest.<br>Eventually finding his grey self,
covered densely in the tall stick trees.
<br><br>
It's important to note that paper people have never quite discovered
fire.
<br><br>
Odd I know. Paper people of course never had to eat, drink or even sleep.<br>
After all to us, they're just drawings on a piece of paper.<br><br>Or in this case,
characters on a web-page.
<br><br>
Erasers have always served as an integral part of paper-kin culture.
<br><br>
With little other necessities, paper-kin as well as other writing-folk<br>
such as marker-people, paint-people, or god forbid chalk-people,<br>
prided themselves on their artistic ability, because that was the only<br>
thing of value they had.<br><br>

Unfortunately unlike the other books in the library, <b>paper-people lived
	alongside penned-people.</b>
