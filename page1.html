			<h2>Say Hello To Paper Samuel!</h2>
			<p>
A world of paper is just as real as any world don't you agree?
<br>
<br>
Maybe you don't, and maybe they can persuade you.
<br>
<br>
Who you ask? Here's one, <b>look!</b>

Just right below.
<br> <br>
Paper Samuel, maybe. He's an odd one, even for a paper person.<br>
He's an explorer. At least that's what he tells himself and his friends.

<p>Here's an illustration of the paper world.</p>
<p>
He says hello. Maybe you should too? But that's besides the point.
<br><br>

Of course Paper Samuel may not be his real name, but he prefers that
kind of privacy.
<br><br>
Samuel was quite bored and decided he wanted to try camping, so here he is at the entrance of a forest.
<br>
<br>He's never quite camped before, but he's hoping nothing goes wrong.
