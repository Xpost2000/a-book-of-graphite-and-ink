				Of course Samuel wasn't the only explorer in the forest. Near by, hearing the efforts<br>
				of the paper-person, a pen-person was listening in.
				<br><br>
				His name is <b>Manny</b>. Not <b>Paper Manny</b>. Just <b>Manny</b>.
				<br><br>
				He too was in the forest to just explore for the hell of it.
				<br><br>
				This was the first time he had really set of exploring
				<br><br>
				and frankly, Manny was just bored. He could've been drawing
				<br><br>
				abominations of nature, but that was just another Tuesday for
				paper-kin.

<p><i><b>*Failure to light the fire caused Samuel to have a breakdown.</b></i></p>
It has been nearly half an hour since Samuel started attempting
to light his fire.
<br><br>
He had become angry and annoyed at the lack of a fire.<br>Perhaps
he was even crying?<br><br>But then what are tears from within a piece
of paper?<br><br><i>Hmmm..... What would that be like anyways? <b>Well anyways!</b></i>
<br><br>
At the sound of the distress, Manny had decided to investigate the
noise to find a disenchanted Samuel.

Samuel was scared of Manny, for he had never seen penned-person
up close. Much less in person.
<br><br>
He was panicking, frantically he tried to crawl away from the penned-man
and run away.
<br><br>

Manny looked confused as he saw Samuel attempt to scuttle away.
<br><br>

This little play quite comically, continued for nearly an hour.
<br><br>

At the end Samuel was at the top of a tree.
<br><br>

By the time he had calmed down, he was too afraid to drop down.
<br><br>

Not that he could feel pain, but it was just some inherent fear of
heights.
<br><br>

Manny decided make camp with Samuels fire.<br><br>While Samuel elected
to fall a sleep at the top of a tree for the night.
