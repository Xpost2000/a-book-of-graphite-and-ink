			Come morning, Samuel had fallen down from the tree.
			<br> <br>
			Manny was jolted awakened by the sudden drop, and once again Samuel<br>
			had panicked because he had forgotten what had happened the day before.
			<br> <br>
			After Samuel had calmed down, Manny opened his non-existant mouth and
			began to speak.
			<br> <br>
			<i><b>"Why are you afraid of me?"</b></i>
			<br> <br>
			Samuel did not expect a voice, that frankly sounded like his own.
			<br> <br>
			<i><b>"Why have you not erased me yet?"</b></i>
			<br> <br>
			The other stick figure, gave a confused look, if that was even possible,<br>
			and asked back.
			<br> <br>
			<i><b>"What's an eraser?"</b></i>
			<br> <br>
			This small interaction dispelled many disillusions the two had
			about each other.
			<br> <br>
			<i>Maybe that's all it takes?
			<br> <br>
			Who knows, certainly not me. Maybe not even you.</i>
