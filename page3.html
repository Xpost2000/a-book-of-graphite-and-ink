			<h2>Diversity</h2>
			<p>
Paper Samuel had been taught all his life that the "other" people were mean.
<br><br>
For what reason?<br><br>Samuel never knew. The first meeting of penned-people and paper-people
before<br>the invention of loose-leaf was a long time ago.
<br><br>
There was no particular reason, but penned-people always looked harsher than paper-people.
<br>Perhaps that was just how they were drawn in the particular book.
<br><br>
Either way, something about that idea <b>frightened</b> our little paper-person.
<br><br>
Of course it's to be understood that, these paper-kin had never seen each other before.
<br><br>
They always served as the villains of paper-tales or story-time to scare little paper people.
<br><br>
<b>After all, what better enemy than someone who can't be identified with?</b>

			When Paper Samuel was a little stick-figure.<br>His mother read him all sorts of paper stories.
	<br>Although he preferred the books the bigger stick-figures were reading. 
<br><br>
They were always more fantastical for him.<br>
He never was able to keep attention for long periods of time.
