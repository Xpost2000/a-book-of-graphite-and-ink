				In the mean time from that little diversion, Samuel has found a clearing<br>
				in the forest.
				<br> <br>
				He appears to be trying to start a fire with a flint and rock set but to no avail.
				<br><br>
				For some reason he just can't get a strong enough spark to light the flame.
				<br><br>
				He would smack and scratch the rock against the flint only to produce very dim sparks.
				<br><br>
				<!--Yeah Color was a pretty important thing-->
				Samuel was unable to get the <b>dark color</b> that fire in this book required.
