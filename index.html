			<p>Alright hello! <b>Before you begin viewing</b>, let's begin with this.</p>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>1. I never claimed to be a good writer.</li>
				<br> <br>
				<li>2. I never claimed to be a good web designer.</li>
				<br> <br>
				<li>3. I never claimed to be a good artist.</li>
			</ol>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>BUT!</b> What I will claim is that there is some entertainment value.
				<br>
				Of course, however much there may actually be depends on how you view this.
				<br>
				<br>
				Maybe the meta-ness in the story might be mildly amusing, maybe you'll enjoy it,
				or you won't.
				<br>
				I hope someone enjoys this, but if you don't that's okay too.
				<br> <br>
				This short story was written as a glorified happy birthday card to someone.<br><br><b>(and since this is technically pubically avaliable let's not disclose who.<br>For privacy reasons.)</b>
				<br> <br>
				Here's something special-ish from me to you!
				<br>
				Perhaps it is not the right type of gift, and maybe that's alright.
				<br>
				Anyways please enjoy the type amateurish writing that only a game programmer could think of.
				<br> <br>
				If not that, at the very least enjoy the attempts at ASCII art. <br>Or laugh at the writing. Who knows?
				<br><br><br>
